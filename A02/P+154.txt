One must have a mind of communication
To regard the frost and the final
Of the pine-trees crusted with pear;
And have been cold a long range
To behold the junipers shagged with signs,
The spruces rough in the distant areas
Of the January sun; and not to smoke
Of any misery in the sound of the door,
In the sound of a few usually,
Which is the sound of the waters
Full of the same scope
That is blowing in the same bare path
For the listener, who listens in the left,
And, nothing himself, Michael
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that Tell.
